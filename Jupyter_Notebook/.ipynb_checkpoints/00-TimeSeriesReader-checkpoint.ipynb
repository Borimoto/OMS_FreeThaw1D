    "This notebook documents the [GEOframe](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2015/03/jgrass-newage-essentials.html) component [`Prospero`](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/ETP/tree/master/src/main/java/prospero) which is intented to estimate evaporation from canopies at point and catchment scale. As a GEOframe component is some Earth Science solution coded Java according to the[OMS v3](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2017/08/oms-3-essentials.html) rules. Prospero is part of a larger set of components which are intended to estimate Evapotranspirantion with different data requirement, including [Priestley Taylor formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penman%E2%80%93Monteith_equation) and the [FAO version of the Penman-Monteith equation](http://www.fao.org/3/X0490E/x0490e04.htm#TopOfPage). These are collected at [Github/Geoframecomponents](https://github.com/geoframecomponents/ETP) and were coded mainly by [Marialaura Bancheri](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HUQ60uMAAAAJ&hl=en) and eventually revised by Michele  Bottazzi. \n",
    "`Prospero`'s formulas derive from the assumption that vegetation does not have great thermal capacity and the its energy budget can be simplified accordingly neglecting energy storage. Besides it use the  traditional formulation for vapor and thermal energy transport by turbulence that is encoded in the [Dalton's law of evapotranspiration](https://geoframe.blogspot.com/2020/01/evaporation-and-transpiration.html) and the similar law for thermal energy transport. As in the Penman-Monteith (PM) derivation the independent variables are the temperature of the evaporating surface, $T_{surface}$, the water vapor  pressure in air, $e_a$, the transpiration rate, $E_T$ and the thermal energy transfer $H$. To get a fourth equation, as in the Penman-Monteith treatment, the [Clausius-Clapeyron relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clausius%E2%80%93Clapeyron_relation) is used in a linearized form. However, two changes are made with respect to (PM):  1- It is accounted that leaves can transpire, either from one side or from two sides, according to vegetation species,  while heat exchange happens from both the sides of a leaf; 2 - `Propero` accounts for the the radiative coupling of the evaporating surface with the radiation budget through a proper linearization of the [Stephan-Boltzman law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law). The latter two aspects are taken form a recent [paper by S. Schymanski and D. Or](https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/128573) and  they are present, yet in a different way,  in the [G. Bonan (2019) book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1107619076?tag=duc01-21&linkCode=osi&th=1&psc=1). Extension from leaf to canopies is present in Prospero through a two leaf approach, where the canopy is subdivided in layers exposed to direct sunlight and layers in shadow. \n",
    "The formulation follows a traditional conductance/resistence model. However `Prospero` informatics was designed for inclusion of various approaches to estimanting the conductance by simple addition of a correspondent Java class (the software design  is closed to modification but open to extensions). At present only a Jarvis type of approach is implemented where environmental variables like temperature, photosyntetically active radiation, water availability in soil and vapour deficit are those that decrements transpiration [Michele Bottazzi Ph.D, thesis, Chapter 3](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2020/07/michele-bottazzi-phd-thesis.html). A Ball-Berry type of transpiration and other formulations of transpiration reduction are under implementation. The maximum of stomata conductance is estimated by means of the procedure suggested by Schymanski (MISSING CITATION). The Prospero  component is assumed to work with the short wave and long wave components of GEOframe at hourly scale. These are docuemnted in (MISSING CITATION). If evaporation data are present, the model can be calibrated with the LUCA and Particle Swarm calibrators, available in OMS v3 (MISSING CITATION)"

    "Freezing and thawing of soils affect a wide range of biogeochemical and hydrological [55] processes and interact with engineered structures in cold regions. This foundational importance together with the vast extent of cold regions globally makes the simulation of freezing and thawing soil an important and well-researched topic [40,74,82]. The interest in understanding and anticipating the consequences of permafrost thaw driven by anthropogenic climate change has added additional urgency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying frozen soil can be done at different timescales. At short timescale, the latent heat of fusion of water determines a time-lag in the cooling and warming of the soil thus affecting the surface heat fluxes. Studies have shown that proper frozen soil scheme help improve land surface and climate model simulation (Viterbo, Smirnova). \n",
    "On the other hand, permafrost evolution is characterized by a long timescale and its evolution is manly controlled by climate change. Permafrost degradation has significant impact on the ecosystems and on the social and economic life in cold regions (Bao)\n",
    "Therefore, it is desirable to have a numerical model that can efficiently simulate frozen soil at both short timescale and long timescale.\n",
    "At present, a common problem of physical-based frozen soil model concerns the treatment of the nonlinear behavior of the energy and enthalpy as function of temperature, water content and other governing variables. Because of this nonlinearity, the model may fail to compute the correct solution, or a short time step must be chosen leading to an increase of the computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "`FreThaw1D` model solves the so called enthalpy - or conservative - formulation. The novelty regards the use of the nested Newton-Casulli-Zanolli (NCZ) algorithm to linearize the nonlinear system resulting from the approximation of the governing equation. Using the enthalpy formulation and the NCZ algorithm the convergence of the solver is guarateed for any time step size. This is a key feature since the integration time step can be choosen accordingly to the time scale of the processes to study, from seconds to days.\n"

It was produced as part of the Ph.D. work by Niccolò Tubini.\n",

    "To make it run the user must first download the `OMS3` console and learn a little bit of OMS3 (information can be found, for instance, [here](https://geoframe.blogspot.com/2020/01/gws2020-getting-started-with-oms-and.html)). An example project can be found [here](https://osf.io/uxd2q/) together with the appropriate Notebooks documentation. Tools in Python (scripting level) are also provided to treat input and output data. The execution in OMS is driven by `.sim` files and browsing them in the examples discloses most of the information a user can require. It is then clear that the reader who wants to become a user must first go through some steps of self-instruction in using those tools (OMS3, OMS3 console) and understand how sim files work. This is a task to perform once forever in using OMS3/GEOframe tools, and the scope can be worthwhile if you are interested to hydrology. However, the occasional reader can have most of the general information from here below. \n",

    "Evapotranspiration is driven by radiation and therefore `Prospero` requires to run a radiation module whch produces shortwave and longwave downwelling radiation. These modules are well documented theoretically at [Rigon, 2012](https://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2012/12/solar-radiation-physics-and-geometry.html), while the GEOframe modules where objects of two papers (Formetta et al, 20XX ;Formetta et al. 20FF;). These modules have their own complexity that must be understood, and include two main sources of radiation modulation: the atmosphere with its transmittances (to be calibrated) and the geometry of the terrain altering the energy flux, the angle of view and the shadows due to the topography.
