    "The input and output are handled with Python. We suggest to use Anaconda to install Python and all the required packages. In order to facilitate the installation we provide a [Conda environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/concepts/environments.html) containg all the required packages. The _geoframe_vicenza.yaml_ file can be found in this folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having installed [Anconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) the Conda environment can be created following these steps:\n",
    "- open Anaconda prompt\n",
    "- set in the folder containing the file *geoframe_vicenza.yaml*\n",
    "-  `conda env create -f geoframe_vicenza.yaml`\n",
